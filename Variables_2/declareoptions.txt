The declare or typeset builtins, which are exact synonyms, permit modifying the properties of variables. This is a very weak form of the typing available in certain programming languages. The declare command is specific to version 2 or later of Bash

-r readonly
-i integer
-a array
-f functions
-x export
    This declares a variable as available for exporting outside the environment of the
    script itself
